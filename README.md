# Deep-Hallucination-Classification
I trained a model for deep hallucination classification using CNN and KNN. This is a multi-way classification task in which an image must be classified into one of the 96 classes.
Project Report
The report should follow these guidelines:

Include a description of your machine learning approaches including the chosen feature set (HOG features, etc.), the tested models (K-NN, SVM, CNN, etc.). Details should also include data preprocessing / augmentation, feature representation and details / proof (via tables / figures) of hyperparameter tuning (learning rate, performance function, regularization, etc.). A minimum of 3 pages (excluding tables and figures) is expected. Documenting all the tried approaches (even unsuccessful ones) is required.
Document and use at least two different machine learning models (required).
Report classification accuracy rates, precision and recall for each class, and confusion matrices for the provided validation set with various models. Use tables / figures to report these. (required).
